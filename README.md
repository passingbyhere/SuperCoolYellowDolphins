  We used ArrayPriorityQueue to create a ticket line for people using the Help Desk and different variables for the type of problem the user is experiencing, their priority, and their employment. Each level of employment has a different priority. These variables are used to create a unique ticket for the user. The ticket also has the unique ID number, status of the problem (solved or unsolved) and the solution.
